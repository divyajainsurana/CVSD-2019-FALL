(A) 
A-1.How many flip-flops are chained? 
32

A-2.How many scan cells in every scan chain, respectively? 
Some have 27 and others have 26

A-3.What are the inputs and outputs of these scan chains? 
test_siXX for scan chain XX
test_soXX for scan chain XX

A-4.What is the name of the scan enable pin for your scan chain? 
test_se

(B) B-1.What is the area before scan chain insertion?
1663032.755070
 B-2.What is the area after scan chain insertion?
1940998.143150
 B-3.How much is the area overhead percentage of scan chain? 
16.714%

B-4.Try to explain why scan chain introduces area overhead. 
Scan-chain consumes a lot of routing resources.

(C) Ignore the input external and output external delay. C-1.How long (ns) is the critical path delay before scan chain insertion?
0.12 ns
 C-2.How long the critical path after scan chain insertion?
0.31 ns
 C-3.How many percent is the path delay overhead? 
30%

C-4.Sometimes, the individual gate delay changes in the critical path. 
Try to explain why? 
The increase of delay along the normal data paths include:
—Extra gate delay due to the multiplexer
—Extra delay due to the capacitive loading of the scan-wiring at each flip-flop’s output


(D) 
D-1.How many total faults (uncollapsed) are there in the circuit? 
81677 

D-2.How many patterns do we have? 
193

D-3.What is the test coverage (%)?
 99.72%
 D-4.What is the fault coverage (%)? 
99.74%
